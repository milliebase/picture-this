## Code review

[ ] You can use Lazy loading to your images (all)

[ ] In your functions to make it more clear what it returns in addition to your comments after declaring the function. example: function authenticateUser(PDO $pdo) ```:void```

[ ] In email.php l.11, settings.js l.175 and settings.php l.75, l.79 you spelled address wrong (don’t shoot me)

[ ] You forgot to remove a comment in register.css, l. 36.

[x] Edit post javascript, it saves new information first time. second time it saves but it doesn’t show (not certain where in code though)

* Overall you Rock!
